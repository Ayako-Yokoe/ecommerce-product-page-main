## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   CSS Grid
-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   TailwindCSS

### What I learned

This time, I switched from Vanilla JavaScript to React. It was challenging to pass data between components while maintaining a single source of truth.
Additionally, changing the color of the given SVG images was quite difficult. However, I found a great resource that I can now use whenever I need to make such style changes.

```html
{/* Close Button */}
<button
...
>
  <div
    className="w-5 h-5 bg-white transition-all duration-300 hover:bg-orange"
    style={{
      WebkitMaskImage: "url(/images/icon-close.svg)",
      WebkitMaskRepeat: "no-repeat",
      WebkitMaskSize: "contain",
      maskImage: "url(/images/icon-close.svg)",
      maskRepeat: "no-repeat",
      maskSize: "contain",
    }}
  ></div>
</button>
```

### Continued development

I'll continue coding using libraries such as React, TailwindCSS, Next.js, and TypeScript for large-scale and dynamic projects."
